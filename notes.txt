To share files in a Flutter app, the recommended method is to use the official and well-maintained share_plus package. This package provides a simple interface to use the platform's native share dialog (Android's ACTION_SEND Intent, iOS's UIActivityViewController, etc.). 
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Add the Package to Your Project
Open your pubspec.yaml file and add share_plus to your dependencies: 
yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  share_plus: ^9.0.0 # Use the latest version
  path_provider: ^2.0.0 # Recommended for accessing local directories
Then run flutter pub get in your terminal. 
2. Import the Package 
In the Dart file where you want to implement the sharing functionality, import the library: 
dart
import 'package:share_plus/share_plus.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart'; // Optional, for file paths
import 'dart:io'; // Optional, for file operations
3. Share a File
To share one or multiple files, use the shareXFiles method. This method expects a list of XFile objects, which can be created from a local file path or from raw data. 
Example 1: Sharing a file that already exists on the device's storage
You need the local path (a String) of the file. You can use path_provider to get standard directories like getApplicationDocumentsDirectory. 
dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:share_plus/share_plus.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'dart:io';

// ... Inside your widget class ...

Future<void> _shareFile() async {
  try {
    // 1. Get the application's document directory
    final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    final String filePath = '${directory.path}/example_file.txt';

    // 2. Ensure the file exists (create a dummy one for demonstration)
    final File testFile = File(filePath);
    if (!await testFile.exists()) {
      await testFile.writeAsString('This is a file to be shared.');
    }

    // 3. Create an XFile object from the file path
    final XFile file = XFile(filePath);

    // 4. Invoke the native share dialog
    await Share.shareXFiles([file], text: 'Check out this file!', subject: 'Important Document');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error sharing file: $e');
  }
}
Example 2: Sharing data generated on the fly (e.g., from network bytes)
You can generate file data dynamically and share it using XFile.fromData. The plugin creates a temporary file in the cache directory for sharing. 
You can find an example of how to share generated data using XFile.fromData in the reference document. This method allows you to create a temporary file from raw data like Uint8List and share it, setting the mimeType and name of the file. 
Important Consideration for iPads
When sharing on an iPad, the share dialog is shown as a popover, requiring the sharePositionOrigin parameter. This parameter specifies the location of the UI element that triggered the share action. The reference document provides an example using a Builder widget to get the context of the button and calculate the position to pass to shareXFiles.
